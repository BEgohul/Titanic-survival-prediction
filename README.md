•	The project is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a given passenger would have survived based on their age, gender and passenger class.
•	Cleaned and processed Titanic dataset, identifying key survival factors such as age, gender, and ticket class.
•	Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn to interpret survival trends effectively. 
•	Implemented machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify survival outcomes.
